# Cisco Secure Workload — HIPAA Compliance Framework
## Reference Design | Healthcare Accounts

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Covered entities and business associates handling
electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and the security teams
preparing for an OCR review or proactive HIPAA risk analysis.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *Can I prove ePHI workloads are isolated from non-ePHI systems and
  that the boundary hasn't drifted since the last attestation?*
  (§164.312(a)(1), §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B))
- *When a clinical or billing application is patched, can I show what
  network conversations changed as a result?* (§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D))
- *If an OCR investigator asks for ePHI access logs over a specific
  window, what artifact do I hand over?* (§164.312(b))
- *If a clinician's workstation is compromised, can I demonstrate that
  lateral movement to ePHI systems was structurally prevented, not just
  that it didn't happen to occur?* (§164.308(a)(6), §164.312(a)(1))
- *Are my Business Associate Agreements backed by an actual technical
  boundary, or by trust alone?* (§164.314(a))

**What you'll need.** A current ePHI system inventory, your most recent
§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) risk analysis, and either CSW already deployed or
scope decisions for a planned deployment.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you're scoping; 5–7 if you're ready
to design policy; 9–10 if you're preparing for an audit within the
next quarter.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Continuous ePHI boundary proof via scope + enforce — not just BAA paperwork
- Process-level flow telemetry answers OCR 'who accessed what' faster than SIEM alone
- ADM replaces stale PHI network diagrams with behaviour-derived maps

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

This reference design guides deployment of Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) in healthcare environments to support technical and operational evidence for elements of the HIPAA Security Rule commonly mapped to workload segmentation, logging, and risk-analysis inputs. CSW provides workload-level visibility, micro-segmentation, vulnerability exposure context, and forensic telemetry — all subject to deployment scope and complementary administrative, physical, and organizational controls.

### HIPAA Security Rule Structure

| Safeguard Category | Relevant CSW Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Administrative Safeguards (§164.308) | Policy enforcement evidence, audit-control inputs, risk-analysis data |
| Physical Safeguards (§164.310) | Limited / out of scope; CSW can only provide logical workload-boundary evidence that may support facility or device-control narratives |
| Technical Safeguards (§164.312) | Micro-segmentation, plaintext-flow detection / blocking, audit logs, identity-aware access evidence where integrated |
| Organizational Requirements (§164.314) | BAA scope definition, third-party access control |

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW sensors, confirm the following:

- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-prem) is provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Network connectivity from workloads to CSW cluster (port 443 outbound)
- [ ] Linux/Windows agent compatibility verified for all target workloads
- [ ] Cloud provider accounts connected (AWS, Azure, GCP) via CSW cloud connectors
- [ ] Stakeholders identified: CISO, Compliance Officer, Infrastructure Lead
- [ ] Change management window approved for sensor installation

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 On-Premises Workloads

**Install Software Sensors:**
```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Ubuntu)
rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm    # RHEL/CentOS
dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb     # Ubuntu/Debian

# Verify sensor is running
systemctl status csw-agent
```

**Key Sensor Configuration:**
- Enforcement Mode: **Monitoring Only** (do NOT enforce at this stage)
- Data Collection: Enable process hash, network flow, and vulnerability exposure visibility where supported
- Tags: Apply `env:production`, `compliance:hipaa`, `data:phi` from Day 1

### 3.2 Cloud Workloads (AWS / Azure / GCP)

**Option A — Software Sensor on Cloud VMs:** Same as on-prem install above.

**Option B — CSW Cloud Connectors (agentless):**
```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Add AWS/Azure/GCP connector
  → Provide IAM Role (AWS) or Service Principal (Azure)
  → Enable VPC Flow Log ingestion
```

**Cloud connector provides:**
- Instance inventory auto-discovery
- VPC/VNET flow telemetry
- Security Group / NSG mapping
- Tag-based scope inheritance

### 3.3 Sensor Validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Confirm all sensors show "Active" status
  → Verify telemetry flowing (green flow indicators)
  → Check agent version alignment
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Inventory Design (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 HIPAA Scope Architecture

Design scopes around PHI data classification. Recommended hierarchy:

```
Root Scope
└── Healthcare-Org (top-level)
    ├── PHI-Zone (strict controls)
    │   ├── EHR-Servers
    │   ├── Billing-Systems
    │   ├── Medical-Imaging
    │   └── HL7-Integration
    ├── Clinical-Support (moderate controls)
    │   ├── Clinical-Workstations
    │   └── Lab-Systems
    ├── Corporate-IT (standard controls)
    │   ├── Active-Directory
    │   ├── Email-Servers
    │   └── File-Servers
    └── External-Partners (BAA-covered vendors)
        ├── Clearinghouses
        └── Third-Party-Apps
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters for ePHI Discovery

Create filters to auto-populate scopes before apps are formally identified:

```
Filter: PHI-Zone-Candidates
  - Process contains: "epic", "cerner", "meditech", "allscripts"
  - Port listened: 1521 (Oracle), 5432 (Postgres), 1433 (MSSQL)
  - Tag: data=phi (if pre-tagged in cloud)
  - Hostname contains: "ehr", "emr", "pacs", "hl7"

Filter: High-Value-Databases
  - Process: mysqld, postgres, oracle, sqlserver
  - Listening on: 3306, 5432, 1521, 1433
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

Apply consistent labels across all workloads:

| Label Key | Example Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `env` | production, staging, dev | Environment segregation |
| `compliance` | hipaa, pci, none | Regulatory scope |
| `data` | phi, sensitive, public | Data classification |
| `app` | epic, cerner, custom-ehr | Application identity |
| `owner` | clinical-ops, it-ops | Team accountability |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

### 5.1 ADM Configuration

ADM reveals actual communication patterns — critical for HIPAA access controls.

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → New Workspace
  → Name: "Healthcare-HIPAA-ADM"
  → Select Scope: Healthcare-Org (or PHI-Zone)
  → Time Window: 2–4 weeks (capture business cycles)
  → Start ADM
```

**ADM Collection Settings:**
- Enable **process context** (shows which process opened each connection)
- Enable **user context** if OS sensors support it
- Set retention: minimum 30 days for HIPAA audit trail

### 5.2 ADM Analysis for HIPAA

During ADM review, document the following for each application cluster:

| Question | HIPAA Relevance |
|---|---|
| Which workloads receive connections from outside PHI-Zone? | Unauthorized access risk (§164.312(a)) |
| Are database connections encrypted (port 5432 vs 5432-SSL)? | Encryption in transit (§164.312(e)) |
| Which systems access EHR servers? | Minimum necessary access (§164.312(a)(2)(ii)) |
| Are there unexpected lateral connections within PHI-Zone? | Audit control gap (§164.312(b)) |
| Which external IPs/FQDNs do PHI workloads reach? | Business Associate identification (§164.314) |

### 5.3 ePHI App Identification Workflow

Since apps are not yet identified, use ADM output to classify:

1. **Export ADM clusters** → review process names + ports
2. **Interview app owners** → confirm which clusters handle PHI
3. **Tag confirmed PHI apps** in CSW inventory
4. **Move tagged workloads** into PHI-Zone scope
5. **Re-run ADM** scoped to PHI-Zone only for policy generation

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35)

### 6.1 HIPAA-Aligned Policy Framework

Translate HIPAA controls into CSW policy constructs:

**Absolute Policies (Always Enforced):**
```
DENY: Any → PHI-Zone (default deny inbound)
DENY: PHI-Zone → Internet (no direct internet from PHI workloads)
DENY: Corporate-IT → PHI-Zone (IT admin traffic blocked except jump hosts)
```

**Allowlist Policies (Least Privilege):**
```
ALLOW: EHR-Servers ↔ Billing-Systems (port 443, 8443)
ALLOW: Clinical-Workstations → EHR-Servers (port 443)
ALLOW: HL7-Integration → EHR-Servers (port 2575 HL7 MLLP)
ALLOW: EHR-Servers → Active-Directory (port 389, 636 LDAP/LDAPS — LDAPS only for HIPAA)
ALLOW: Jump-Host → PHI-Zone (port 22, 3389 for admin)
ALLOW: PHI-Zone → Monitoring-Stack (port 443 outbound to CSW cluster)
```

**Catch-All (Audit Everything Else):**
```
LOG: Any → PHI-Zone (unmatched flows — triggers alert)
LOG: PHI-Zone → Any (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Setup

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → New Workspace
  → Name: "HIPAA-PHI-Zone-Enforcement"
  → Scope: PHI-Zone
  → Import ADM policies (auto-generated baseline)
  → Review and refine
  → Set mode: Simulation first → then Enforcement
```

### 6.3 Enforcement Progression

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2 weeks | Validate no false positives |
| 2 | Enforcement (low priority rules) | 1 week | Enforce clear blocks |
| 3 | Full Enforcement | Ongoing | Production HIPAA posture |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — HIPAA Control Mapping

### 7.1 Technical Safeguards (§164.312)

| HIPAA Control | Control ID | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Unique User Identification | §164.312(a)(2)(i) | Process-user context in ADM; alert on shared credentials via anomaly detection |
| Emergency Access Procedure | §164.312(a)(2)(ii) | Break-glass policy workspace; alert-only mode for emergency IPs |
| Automatic Logoff | §164.312(a)(2)(iii) | Enforce session policies via network controls; short-lived allow rules |
| Encryption & Decryption | §164.312(a)(2)(iv) | CSW identifies unencrypted PHI flows (HTTP vs HTTPS, LDAP vs LDAPS) |
| Audit Controls | §164.312(b) | Full flow telemetry retained; process-level audit trail |
| Integrity Controls | §164.312(c) | Policy violation alerts; workload hash verification |
| Authentication | §164.312(d) | Enforce LDAPS/Kerberos paths; block unauthenticated DB access |
| Encryption in Transit | §164.312(e)(2)(ii) | Detect and block unencrypted PHI flows; enforce TLS-only paths |

### 7.2 Administrative Safeguards (§164.308)

| HIPAA Control | Control ID | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Risk Analysis | §164.308(a)(1) | Vulnerability detection reports; CVE mapping to PHI workloads |
| Workforce Access Management | §164.308(a)(3) | Scope-based policy enforcement; access logs per workload |
| Security Incident Procedures | §164.308(a)(6) | Forensic telemetry for incident reconstruction; anomaly alerts |
| Contingency Plan | §164.308(a)(7) | Policy export/backup; DR policy workspace |
| Evaluation | §164.308(a)(8) | Compliance dashboard; drift detection alerts |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability & Risk Management

### 8.1 Vulnerability Detection

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: PHI-Zone
  → Filter: CVSS Score ≥ 7.0
  → Export for compliance evidence
```

**HIPAA Relevance:** §164.308(a)(1) requires ongoing risk analysis. CSW vulnerability data can inform that analysis with workload-level CVE mapping, but it remains one input among threat, impact, control-testing, BAA, and operational-risk evidence.

### 8.2 Prioritization for PHI Workloads

```
Priority 1: Critical CVEs (CVSS 9.0+) on EHR/Billing servers → Patch within 24 hours
Priority 2: High CVEs (CVSS 7.0–8.9) on PHI-Zone → Patch within 7 days
Priority 3: Medium CVEs on Clinical-Support → Patch within 30 days
```

### 8.3 Compensating Controls via CSW

When patching is delayed, implement compensating controls in CSW:
- Restrict vulnerable port to approved source IPs only
- Add anomaly detection alert for the vulnerable process
- Log all connections to affected workload for manual review

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting

### 9.1 HIPAA-Required Alerts

Configure the following alerts in CSW:

| Alert | Trigger | HIPAA Control |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorized PHI Access | Any unapproved source → PHI-Zone | §164.312(a) |
| Unencrypted PHI Flow | HTTP/FTP detected from PHI-Zone | §164.312(e) |
| Lateral Movement | New east-west flow within PHI-Zone | §164.308(a)(6) |
| External Exfiltration | PHI-Zone → Unknown external IP | §164.312(e) |
| Policy Violation | Enforced policy block triggered | §164.308(a)(6) |
| Vulnerability Spike | New Critical CVE on PHI workload | §164.308(a)(1) |
| Sensor Offline | Agent stops reporting | §164.312(b) |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry for Incident Response

CSW retains full network + process telemetry. For HIPAA breach investigation:

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → Time range: incident window
  → Source/Destination: affected workload
  → Export: full flow log with process context

CSW UI → Investigate → Process Search
  → Filter: PHI workload + time range
  → Identify anomalous processes + parent-child relationships
```

Retain forensic exports for minimum **6 years** per HIPAA documentation requirements.

---

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Audit Cycle (Quarterly Recommended)

| Evidence Item | CSW Source | HIPAA Control |
|---|---|---|
| Policy enforcement log | Defend → Policy Analysis | §164.312(a) |
| Vulnerability exposure report | Investigate → Vulnerability | §164.308(a)(1) |
| Flow audit log (PHI-Zone) | Investigate → Flow Search | §164.312(b) |
| Policy violation report | Alerts → Triggered Events | §164.308(a)(6) |
| Scope membership snapshot | Inventory → Export | §164.308(a)(3) |
| Encryption compliance | Flow analysis (protocol filter) | §164.312(e) |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- Schedule **monthly** scope/inventory reviews — workloads join/leave PHI-Zone
- Schedule **quarterly** policy workspace reviews — validate rules still reflect ADM
- Track **policy drift** — compare current policy to baseline export
- Maintain **ADM re-runs** every 90 days to detect new application dependencies

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| PHI workload not in correct scope | Run ADM with labels; review scope membership weekly |
| Encryption detected but on wrong port | Validate TLS termination points; don't assume SSL by port number |
| Cloud workloads missing from inventory | Verify cloud connector permissions (read access to EC2/VMs) |
| Policy too broad (subnet-level instead of workload) | Use workload identity (OS fingerprint, process hash) not just IP |
| ADM run too short | Always run minimum 2 weeks; include month-end processing cycles |
| Enforcement breaks a clinical application | Always run simulation mode first; stage rollout by scope |
